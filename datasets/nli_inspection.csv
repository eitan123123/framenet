ID,Frame #,Sentence,Verb,Object,Envoked Frame,,Ground Truth (Manually Checking),Notes,Did the model Predicte the Frame,Frame Definition
1,1,I open the door.,open,door,Closure,,yes,,,"An Agent manipulates a Fastener to open or close a Containing_object (e.g. coat, jar).  Sometimes an Enclosed_region or a Container_portal may be expressed. Since the Manipulator is syntactically omissible, many verbs in this frame incorporate the Fastener.  'Mary closed her coat with a belt.' 'Mary closed her coat with one hand.' 'Mary buttoned her coat .'"
1,2,I open the door.,open,door,Body_movement,,no,,,"This frame contains words for motions or actions an Agent performs using some part of his/her body.   A number of words in this frame occur as blends with Communication, in which the action has an Addressee.  For example,   'Pat nodded at Kim.'  These examples differ from Communication.Gesture in that no specific message need be expressed, as in  'She nodded to him to sit down.'  Since this frame involves a particular type of motion, it contains the frame elements Source, Path, Goal and Area, which originate in the motion frame.  All of these frame elements are generally expressed in PP Complements.  'The boy swung his legs from under the table.'"
1,3,I open the door.,open,door,Activity_start,,no,,,"An Agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing Activity in which he will be continuously involved. '' 'At the same time, city-states began to grow in influence on the southern Greek mainland.'  'Naturally, I started crying to get out of work.'  "
20,1,I smash the guitar.,smash,guitar,Cause_harm,,no,,,"The words in this frame describe situations in which an Agent or a Cause injures a Victim. The Body_part of the Victim which is most directly affected may also be mentioned in the place of the Victim.  In such cases, the Victim is often indicated as a genitive modifier of the Body_part, in which case the Victim FE is indicated on a second FE layer. '' 'Rod saw his father beating his mother.'  'In the end Wormtongue is fed up with being beaten so he cuts Saruman's throat to free himself.'  'A mother stabbed to death by her husband made a secret will stating that he must never be allowed to care for their son.'"
15,1,I sharpen the pencil.,sharpen,pencil,Cause_to_be_sharp,,yes,,,An Agent or Cause makes a Patient sharper or duller.  An Instrument or Means may be mentioned.  'John is in the basement sharpening his axe.'
14,4,I drop the pencil.,drop,pencil,Giving_birth,,no,,,A Mother and Father produce a Child or an Egg. 'Betty bore Gerry three intelligent daughters.'
8,2,I tear the backpack.,tear,backpack,Cause_to_fragment,,yes,,,"An Agent suddenly and often violently separates the Whole_patient into two or more smaller Pieces, resulting in the Whole_patient no longer existing as such.  Several lexical items are marked with the semantic type Negative, which indicates that the fragmentation is necessarily judged as injurious to the original Whole_patient.  Compare this frame with Damaging, Render_non-functional, and Removing.  'He ripped up the letter faster than you can say ""Jack Robbins"". INI' 'Don't go in there or you 'll be torn to bits! CNI' 'She shattered the vase with a casual backhand blow to make it look like there had been a struggle. INI' 'Tear into 6"" strips, each about one inch wide, then bake at 400. CNI CNI'"
14,3,I drop the pencil.,drop,pencil,Change_position_on_a_scale,,yes,,,"This frame consists of words that indicate the change of an Item's position on a scale (the Attribute) from a starting point (Initial_value) to an end point (Final_value). The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP ""turbot catches"" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to ""the people"", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP ""the population of Smallville"" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer ""of Smallville"" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute ""1999 price"" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as ""price"" on the 2nd layer. "
8,3,I tear the backpack.,tear,backpack,Damaging,,yes,,,"An Agent affects a Patient in such a way that the Patient (or some Subregion of the Patient) ends up in a non-canonical state.  Often this non-canonical state is undesirable, and some lexical units (marked with the Negative semantic type) specifically indicate that the Patient is negatively affected.  Some lexical units of this frame indicate by what means the Patient is altered (e.g., scrape.v) and in some cases give some indication of the detailed effect on the Patient (e.g., score.v, chip.v), and in other cases, both are specified (tear.v). For another set of lexical units, the action and its result are much less specified (e.g., damage.v).  Compare this frame with Destroying, Cause_to_fragment, and Render_nonfunctional.  'That idiot just dented my car!' 'Some ne'er-do-wells defaced the Park's wall with spray paint to show their anger at local natural resources allocation policy.' 'Please don't damage the goods.'"
