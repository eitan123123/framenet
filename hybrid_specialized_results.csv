I open the door.,Closure,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a the door .,0.6,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the door"" involves an Agent (""I"") manipulating an object (""the door"") to change its state from closed to open, which aligns with the core action described in the Closure frame. However, the Closure frame emphasizes the manipulation of a Fastener, which is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the given sentence. The action described in the sentence is more direct and does not necessarily involve a fastener (e.g., a lock, knob, or handle) as an intermediary in the opening action. Therefore, while the sentence shares some thematic elements with the Closure frame, the lack of specificity regarding the manipulation of a Fastener reduces the alignment with the frame's core definition.

I open the door.,Body_movement,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.6,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the door"" involves a physical action performed by an agent (I) using a part of their body to achieve a change in state (the door being opened). The core action of opening aligns with the idea of performing a motion or action using the body, as described in the Body_movement frame. However, the specific action of opening a door might not perfectly align with the typical examples or the core focus of the Body_movement frame, which emphasizes the motion aspect more than the interaction with objects to change their state. The sentence does not explicitly mention the body part used or the motion involved, which are central to the Body_movement frame's definition. Therefore, while there is a physical action performed by an agent, the focus on opening an object might be better captured by a different frame that specifically addresses interactions with objects and their state changes.

I open the door.,Activity_start,an agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved.,I initiate the beginning of an ongoing open in which he will be continuously involved .,0.2,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the door"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (open) on an object (the door). However, the ""Activity_start"" frame is about initiating an ongoing Activity in which the Agent will be continuously involved. Opening a door is a discrete, one-time action rather than the beginning of an ongoing activity in which the Agent is continuously involved. Therefore, the core semantic roles and overall meaning of the ""Activity_start"" frame do not align perfectly with the sentence.

Confidence: 0.2"
I close the door.,Closure,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a the door .,0.85,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the door"" aligns well with the core definition of the Closure frame, where an Agent (I) manipulates a Containing_object (the door) to close it. However, the specific mention of manipulating a Fastener to achieve closure is not present in the sentence, which might suggest a slight deviation from the full frame definition. Despite this, the core action of closing and the roles of Agent and Containing_object are perfectly matched, indicating that the essence of the Closure frame is preserved even without explicit mention of a Fastener.

Confidence: 0.85"
I close the door.,Body_movement,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.5,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the door"" involves a physical action performed by an Agent (I) on an object (the door). While this action indeed involves body movement, the primary focus is not on the motion of the body part itself but on the effect that motion has on an external object. The Body_movement frame emphasizes motions or actions performed using the body, without necessarily focusing on the interaction with objects to achieve a specific change in state, such as closing a door. Therefore, the core semantic roles of the Body_movement frame do not align perfectly with the elements in the sentence, as the sentence's main focus is on the action's outcome (the door being closed) rather than the motion of the body part.

I close the door.,Locale_closure,"a building or location that can be sealed to prevent entrance, the locale, ceases to be open for use.","a building or location that can be sealed to prevent entrance , the the door , ceases to be open for use .",0.6,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the door"" involves a physical action performed by an agent (I) on an object (the door) to change its state from open to closed. The core semantic roles in the Locale_closure frame involve a location being sealed to prevent entrance, which indirectly involves the action of closing something like a door. However, the frame's focus is on the broader effect of a location becoming inaccessible, rather than the specific action of closing a door to achieve this state. Therefore, while the action of closing the door is related to the idea of a locale becoming closed, the sentence's focus on the specific action does not perfectly align with the frame's emphasis on the overall state of the locale being sealed off.

I knock on the door.,Cause_harm,the words in this frame describe situations in which an agent or a cause injures a victim.,the words in this frame describe situations in which I or a cause injures a victim .,0.0,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I knock on the door"" does not align with the ""Cause_harm"" frame because the action of knocking on a door does not inherently involve causing injury to a victim. The core elements of the ""Cause_harm"" frame involve an Agent causing injury to a Victim, which does not match the context of the given sentence where the action is simply knocking on a door without any implication of harm or injury. Therefore, the semantic roles and the overall meaning of the ""Cause_harm"" frame do not apply to the sentence.

Confidence: 0.0"
I knock on the door.,Cause_motion,"an agent causes a theme to move from a source, along a path, to a goal.","I cause a theme to move from a source , along a path , to a the door .",0.2,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I knock on the door"" does not align well with the core elements of the Cause_motion frame. In this sentence, the action of knocking does not cause a theme to move from a source, along a path, to a goal. Instead, the action is about creating a sound by hitting a surface (the door), without causing any object to change location or state in the manner described by the Cause_motion frame. The core semantic roles of Agent, Theme, Source, Path, and Goal do not map perfectly onto the elements of the sentence, as the sentence primarily involves an Agent (I) performing an action (knock) on a surface (the door) without causing motion of an object from one place to another.

I knock on the door.,Impact,"while in motion, an impactor makes sudden, forcible contact with the impactee, or two impactors both move, mutually making forcible contact.","while in motion , I make sudden , forcible contact with the the door , or two I both move , mutually making forcible contact .",0.7,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I knock on the door,"" the action of knocking involves making sudden, forcible contact, which aligns with the core definition of the Impact frame. The ""I"" serves as the Impactor, and ""the door"" serves as the Impactee. However, the action of knocking is typically more controlled and less forceful than the examples implied by the full frame definition, which suggests a higher level of force and motion (e.g., ""The massive metal foot hit the ground with a huge thud""). Therefore, while the basic elements of the Impact frame are present, the intensity and context might not align perfectly with the frame's typical examples.

I open the backpack.,Closure,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a the backpack .,0.9,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the backpack"" aligns well with the core elements of the Closure frame. The Agent (""I"") manipulates a Fastener (implied, as backpacks typically have zippers, buckles, or similar fasteners) to open a Containing_object (""the backpack""). The action and its direct effect—opening—are explicitly mentioned, fitting the frame's core definition of manipulating a fastener to open or close a containing object. Although the fastener itself is not explicitly mentioned, its presence is inherent in the action of opening a backpack, which matches the frame's allowance for the manipulator (and by extension, the fastener) to be syntactically omissible.

Confidence: 0.9"
I open the backpack.,Body_movement,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.5,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the backpack"" involves a physical action performed by an Agent (I) on an Object (the backpack), which aligns with the notion of performing actions using some part of the body as described in the Body_movement frame. However, the action of opening a backpack does not inherently involve motion of the body in the sense of changing location or position, which is a central aspect of the Body_movement frame as it includes elements like Source, Path, Goal, and Area. The action of opening is more about manipulating an object rather than the body moving through space or changing its position significantly. Therefore, while there is a physical action performed by a body part, the core focus of the Body_movement frame on motion or movement through space does not perfectly align with the action of opening something.

Confidence: 0.5"
I open the backpack.,Activity_start,an agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved.,I initiate the beginning of an ongoing open in which he will be continuously involved .,0.3,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the backpack"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (open) on an object (the backpack). However, the ""Activity_start"" frame is about initiating an ongoing activity in which the agent will be continuously involved, suggesting a temporal duration and involvement that goes beyond the immediate action of opening something. Opening a backpack is typically a discrete, one-time action rather than the beginning of an ongoing activity that the agent is continuously involved in. Therefore, the core semantic roles and the overall meaning of the ""Activity_start"" frame do not align perfectly with the sentence.

Confidence: 0.3"
I close the backpack.,Closure,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a backpack .,0.9,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the backpack"" fits well within the ""Closure"" frame as defined. The Agent (""I"") is performing an action (manipulating a fastener, implied but not explicitly mentioned) to close a Containing_object (""backpack""). The core semantic roles of Agent, Fastener (implied by the action of closing), and Containing_object align perfectly with the elements present in the sentence. The sentence's focus on the physical action of closing and its direct effect on the backpack matches the core meaning of the frame. The absence of a specific fastener (e.g., zipper, button) does not detract from the match, as the frame accounts for the possibility that the Manipulator (in this case, the Agent) can be syntactically omissible or incorporate the Fastener implicitly.

Confidence: 0.9"
I close the backpack.,Body_movement,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.4,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the backpack"" involves a physical action performed by an Agent (I) on an object (the backpack). However, the action of closing a backpack involves manipulating an object rather than performing a motion or action using a part of the body in the sense intended by the Body_movement frame. While the action does indeed require movement (e.g., moving one's hands to zip or buckle the backpack), the primary focus is on the effect on the object (the backpack being closed) rather than the motion of the body part itself. Therefore, the core semantic roles and overall meaning of the Body_movement frame do not perfectly align with the sentence.

Confidence: 0.4"
I close the backpack.,Locale_closure,"a building or location that can be sealed to prevent entrance, the locale, ceases to be open for use.","a building or location that can be sealed to prevent entrance , the the backpack , ceases to be open for use .",0.2,False,"Reasoning: The core semantic roles in the ""Locale_closure"" frame involve a building or location being sealed to prevent entrance, which ceases to be open for use. In the sentence ""I close the backpack,"" the focus is on an object (the backpack) being closed, not a building or location. Therefore, the semantic roles do not align perfectly because the frame's definition specifies a building or location, whereas the sentence involves an object. The action of closing is present in both the frame and the sentence, but the subject of this action (a backpack vs. a building/location) does not match.

Confidence: 0.2"
I tear the backpack.,Experience_bodily_harm,an experiencer is involved in a bodily injury to a body_part.,an experiencer is involved in a bodily injury to a body_part .,0.0,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I tear the backpack"" involves an agent (I) performing an action (tear) on an object (the backpack). This does not align with the ""Experience_bodily_harm"" frame, which requires an experiencer to be involved in a bodily injury to a body part. In the given sentence, there is no mention or implication of bodily injury or an experiencer suffering from such an injury. The action is directed towards an inanimate object rather than a body part, and there is no indication of harm to the agent themselves or another individual.

I tear the backpack.,Cause_to_fragment,"an agent suddenly and often violently separates the whole_patient into two or more smaller pieces, resulting in the whole_patient no longer existing as such.","I suddenly and often violently separates the the backpack into two or more smaller pieces , resulting in the the backpack no longer existing as such .",0.9,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I tear the backpack"" aligns well with the core definition of the ""Cause_to_fragment"" frame, where an Agent (I) performs an action (tear) that results in the Whole_patient (the backpack) being separated into smaller pieces. This action implies that the backpack no longer exists in its original form, which matches the outcome described in the frame definition. The sentence encapsulates the sudden and potentially violent action of tearing, which fits the description of how the fragmentation occurs according to the frame. Therefore, the semantic roles of Agent, Action, and Whole_patient are perfectly mapped to the elements in the sentence.

Confidence: 0.9"
I tear the backpack.,Damaging,an agent affects a patient in such a way that the patient.,I affect a the backpack in such a way that the the backpack .,1.0,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I tear the backpack,"" the Agent (""I"") performs an action (tear) that affects a Patient (""the backpack"") in such a way that it likely ends up in a non-canonical (damaged) state. This aligns perfectly with the core definition of the Damaging frame, where an Agent affects a Patient leading to a non-canonical state. The verb ""tear"" is explicitly mentioned in the full frame definition as an example of an action that specifies both the means by which the Patient is altered and the detailed effect on the Patient, fitting the criteria for a perfect match.

Confidence: 1.0"
I tear the backpack.,Removing,"an agent causes a theme to move away from a location, the source.","I cause a the backpack to move away from a location , the source .",0.2,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I tear the backpack"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (tear) on a Theme (the backpack). However, the core action described does not involve moving the Theme away from a location, which is central to the ""Removing"" frame. Instead, the action of tearing implies damaging or rending the backpack, not relocating it. Therefore, the semantic roles and the core action of tearing do not align with the ""Removing"" frame's definition of causing something to move away from a location.

Confidence: 0.2"
I open the laptop.,Closure,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a laptop .,0.4,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the laptop"" involves an Agent (""I"") performing an action (to ""open"") on a Containing_object (""laptop""). However, the action of opening a laptop typically does not involve manipulating a Fastener in the same way as opening a coat with a belt or buttoning a coat. Laptops are generally opened by lifting a lid or screen rather than manipulating a fastener. Therefore, while the sentence shares some superficial similarities with the Closure frame—such as an Agent acting to change the state of a Containing_object—the core action of manipulating a Fastener to achieve this change is not present. This discrepancy suggests that the sentence does not perfectly align with the Closure frame as defined.

Confidence: 0.4"
I open the laptop.,Body_movement,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.4,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the laptop"" involves an action performed by an agent (I) using a part of their body, likely hands, to perform a motion (open) on an object (the laptop). However, the core of the Body_movement frame emphasizes motions or actions that are primarily bodily without necessarily involving manipulation of objects as a central theme. Opening a laptop involves manipulation of an object rather than a focus on the movement of the body itself, which would be more aligned with frames related to handling or operating objects. Therefore, while there is a bodily action involved in the sentence, the primary focus is not on the body movement itself but on the interaction with an object to achieve a change in its state, which does not perfectly align with the core definition of the Body_movement frame.

Confidence: 0.4"
I open the laptop.,Activity_start,an agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved.,I initiate the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved .,0.4,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the laptop"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (open) on an object (the laptop). However, the action of opening a laptop does not inherently initiate an ongoing Activity in which the Agent will be continuously involved, as specified in the ""Activity_start"" frame. Opening a laptop could be a precursor to an activity (e.g., working, browsing), but the act itself does not guarantee continuous involvement in an activity. Therefore, the core semantic roles and the overall meaning of the ""Activity_start"" frame do not perfectly align with the sentence's context.

I drop the pencil.,Body_movement,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.6,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" involves a physical action performed by an Agent (I) using a part of their body (likely the hand) to cause an object (the pencil) to move from one location to another, which aligns with the core definition of the Body_movement frame. However, the action of dropping does not inherently involve motion of the body part itself in a way that is central to the action's definition, unlike actions such as swinging, nodding, or jumping, which are more prototypical examples of the Body_movement frame. The action of dropping focuses more on the result of the motion (the pencil moving) rather than the motion of the body part itself. Therefore, while there is a physical action performed by an agent using their body, the focus on the object's movement rather than the agent's body movement suggests a partial but not perfect alignment with the Body_movement frame as defined.

Confidence: 0.6"
I drop the pencil.,Path_shape,"the words in this frame describe the ""fictive"" motion of a stationary road.","the words in this frame describe the "" fictive "" motion of a stationary road .",0.0,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" involves a physical action (dropping) and an object (the pencil) affected by this action. The core of this action is the change in the pencil's location due to the act of dropping. The ""Path_shape"" frame, however, is centered around the description of the motion or shape of a path, often in a stationary or ""fictive"" sense, without any actual movement being performed by the path itself. The semantic roles in the ""Path_shape"" frame, such as the path's shape, direction, or its relationship to landmarks, do not align with the elements of the sentence, which involve an actor (I), an action (drop), and an object (the pencil). There is no path being described, nor is there a stationary object being anthropomorphized with motion. Therefore, the core semantic roles and overall meaning of the frame do not apply to the sentence.

I drop the pencil.,Change_position_on_a_scale,this frame consists of words that indicate the change of an item's position on a scale.,this frame consists of words that indicates the change of an the pencil 's position on a scale .,0.1,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" describes a physical action resulting in a change of the pencil's location from a higher to a lower position. This action does not inherently involve a scale, attribute, initial value, final value, path, difference, speed, or correlate as defined in the ""Change_position_on_a_scale"" frame. The core of this frame involves abstract or measurable changes along a defined scale, which does not align with the simple physical action of dropping an object described in the sentence.

Confidence: 0.1"
I drop the pencil.,Giving_birth,a mother and father produce a child or an egg.,a mother and father produce a child or an egg .,0.0,False,"Reasoning: The ""Giving_birth"" frame involves a mother and father producing a child or an egg, focusing on the creation and birth of new life. The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" involves an individual performing a physical action that results in a pencil being moved from a higher to a lower position due to gravity. There are no semantic roles in the sentence that align with those of a mother, father, or a child/egg being produced. Therefore, the core meaning and context of the ""Giving_birth"" frame do not match the action described in the sentence.

Confidence: 0.0"
I drop the pencil.,Motion_directional,"in this frame a theme moves in a certain direction which is often determined by gravity or other natural, physical forces.","in this frame a the pencil moves in a certain direction which is often determined by gravity or other natural , physical forces .",0.9,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" aligns well with the ""Motion_directional"" frame. The pencil (Theme) moves in a certain direction (downward, due to gravity) as a result of the action described by the verb ""drop."" The action is not self-initiated by the pencil, fitting the frame's specification that the Theme is not necessarily a self-mover. The direction of motion is implied to be downward, which is a common understanding when objects are dropped, aligning with the frame's emphasis on movement often determined by gravity.

Confidence: 0.9"
I drop the pencil.,Change_posture,a protagonist changes the overall position and posture of the body.,a protagonist changes the overall position and posture of the body .,0.1,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" involves an action (dropping) performed by an agent (I) on an object (the pencil). The core action is about moving an object rather than changing the position or posture of the agent's body. The ""Change_posture"" frame focuses on a protagonist changing their own body's position or posture, which does not align with the action of dropping an object. Therefore, the semantic roles and the core action of the ""Change_posture"" frame do not map well to the elements and action described in the sentence.

Confidence: 0.1"
I drop the pencil.,Cause_change_of_position_on_a_scale,this frame consists of words that indicate that an agent or a cause affects the position of an item on some scale.,this frame consists of words that indicates that I affect the position of an the pencil on some scale .,0.2,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" describes a physical action where an Agent (I) causes an Item (the pencil) to move, but it does not inherently involve a change of position on a scale in the sense of measuring a value or attribute that changes quantitatively from Value_1 to Value_2. The frame ""Cause_change_of_position_on_a_scale"" is more suited to contexts where there is a measurable change in an attribute or value of an item, such as weight, price, or temperature, rather than a simple physical relocation. The core semantic roles of Agent, Item, and the implied change of position do not align perfectly with the requirement of a scale, initial value, end value, or the other elements like Path, Difference, Speed, or Co_Variable that are central to the frame's definition.

Confidence: 0.2"
I drop the pencil.,Cause_motion,"an agent causes a theme to move from a source, along a path, to a goal.","I cause a the pencil to move from a source , along a path , to a goal .",0.9,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I drop the pencil,"" the Agent (""I"") causes the Theme (the pencil) to move, which aligns with the core definition of the Cause_motion frame. The action of dropping implies motion from a source (the Agent's hand or current position) to a goal (typically, the ground or a surface below the initial position), even though the source and goal are not explicitly mentioned. The frame's flexibility in leaving some elements like Source, Path, and/or Goal implicit supports this mapping. However, the specific manner of motion (dropping) implies a certain control at the Source but not throughout the motion, which is consistent with some examples provided in the frame definition.

Confidence: 0.9"
I sharpen the pencil.,Cause_to_be_sharp,an agent or cause makes a patient sharper or duller.,I make a the pencil sharper or duller .,0.9,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I sharpen the pencil"" aligns well with the ""Cause_to_be_sharp"" frame. The Agent (""I"") performs an action that directly causes the Patient (""the pencil"") to become sharper, which is the core action described in the frame. The verb ""sharpen"" directly matches the frame's core meaning of making something sharper. There is no mention of an Instrument or Means in the sentence, but its absence does not affect the core action of causing something to be sharp, which is fulfilled by the Agent's action on the Patient.

I break the guitar.,Cause_harm,the words in this frame describe situations in which an agent or a cause injures a victim.,the words in this frame describe situations in which I or a cause injures a the guitar .,0.9,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I break the guitar"" aligns well with the ""Cause_harm"" frame, as it describes a situation where an Agent (I) causes harm to a Victim (the guitar). The action of breaking directly results in harm or injury to the guitar, fitting the core definition of the frame that involves an Agent causing injury to a Victim. The sentence does not specify a Body_part since the Victim is an object, not a being with body parts, but this does not detract from the overall match of the frame to the sentence.

This action does not inherently involve following or violating a set of rules or norms, which is the core of the Compliance frame. The Compliance frame is about acts and states of affairs in relation to rules or norms, focusing on the responsibility of protagonists towards these rules or norms. The act of breaking a guitar does not directly imply any adherence to or violation of rules or norms without additional context.

I break the guitar.,Experience_bodily_harm,an experiencer is involved in a bodily injury to a body_part.,an experiencer is involved in a bodily injury to a body_part .,0.0,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I break the guitar"" does not align with the ""Experience_bodily_harm"" frame because the core elements of the frame involve an experiencer receiving bodily injury, whereas the sentence describes an action where an object (the guitar) is being broken by the subject. There is no mention or implication of bodily harm to the subject or any other experiencer. Therefore, the semantic roles of experiencer and body_part from the frame do not map onto any elements in the sentence.

The Agent (""I"") performs an action that results in the Whole_patient (""the guitar"") being separated into pieces, which matches the core definition of the frame. The sentence implies a sudden and possibly violent action leading to the fragmentation of the guitar, fitting the frame's emphasis on the nature of the separation. However, the sentence does not explicitly mention the violence of the action or the resulting pieces, which are part of the full frame definition but not strictly necessary for the core semantic roles to align.

I break the guitar.,Render_nonfunctional,an agent affects an artifact so that it is no longer capable of performing its inherent function.,I affect an the guitar so that it is no longer capable of performing its inherent function .,1.0,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I break the guitar"" aligns well with the ""Render_nonfunctional"" frame. The Agent (""I"") performs an action that affects an Artifact (""the guitar"") in such a way that it is no longer capable of performing its inherent function, which is to produce music. This direct action and its effect on the Artifact's functionality perfectly match the core definition of the frame. The semantic roles of Agent and Artifact are clearly mapped to ""I"" and ""the guitar,"" respectively, and the overall meaning of the frame applies to the sentence without deviation.

Confidence: 1.0"
I break the guitar.,Breaking_off,an single subpart breaks off from a whole.,an single subpart breaks off from a whole .,0.2,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I break the guitar"" does not align with the ""Breaking_off"" frame as defined. The core of the ""Breaking_off"" frame involves a subpart separating from a whole, implying a partitive relationship where a piece becomes detached from a larger entity. In the given sentence, the action of breaking the guitar does not necessarily imply that a part of the guitar breaks off from it; rather, it suggests that the guitar as a whole is being broken, which could mean damage or destruction but not specifically a part detaching. Therefore, the semantic roles and the overall meaning of the ""Breaking_off"" frame do not perfectly map onto the elements and the context of the sentence.

Confidence: 0.2"
I break the guitar.,Breaking_apart,"a whole breaks apart into pieces, resulting in the loss of the whole.","a the guitar breaks apart into pieces , resulting in the loss of the the guitar .",0.8,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I break the guitar"" directly implies an action where the guitar (the Whole) is subjected to a force causing it to break. This aligns with the core definition of the ""Breaking_apart"" frame, where a Whole breaks apart into Pieces, implying the loss of the Whole's original form or function. However, the sentence does not explicitly mention the guitar breaking into pieces or the loss of the guitar, which are key elements of the full frame definition. The action described matches the core action of breaking apart but lacks detail on the aftermath, which is crucial for a perfect match.

I smash the guitar.,Cause_harm,the words in this frame describe situations in which an agent or a cause injures a victim.,the words in this frame describe situations in which I or a cause injures a the guitar .,0.9,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I smash the guitar,"" the Agent (""I"") performs an action (smash) that directly causes harm to the Victim (""the guitar""). This aligns well with the core definition of the Cause_harm frame, which involves an Agent or Cause injuring a Victim. The action of smashing can be considered a form of causing harm, making the guitar the Victim of this action. The sentence does not specify a Body_part, as the Victim is an object, not a being with body parts, but this does not detract from the overall match of the frame to the sentence, as the core elements of Agent and Victim are clearly present and correctly aligned.

I smash the guitar.,Impact,"while in motion, an impactor makes sudden, forcible contact with the impactee, or two impactors both move, mutually making forcible contact.","while in motion , I make sudden , forcible contact with the the guitar , or two I both move , mutually making forcible contact .",1.0,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I smash the guitar,"" the action of smashing involves ""I"" as the Impactor making sudden, forcible contact with ""the guitar,"" which serves as the Impactee.
