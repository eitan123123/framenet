8,I tear the backpack.,3,tear,backpack,Damaging,yes,"An Agent affects a Patient in such a way that the Patient (or some Subregion of the Patient) ends up in a non-canonical state.  Often this non-canonical state is undesirable, and some lexical units (marked with the Negative semantic type) specifically indicate that the Patient is negatively affected.  Some lexical units of this frame indicate by what means the Patient is altered (e.g., scrape.v) and in some cases give some indication of the detailed effect on the Patient (e.g., score.v, chip.v), and in other cases, both are specified (tear.v). For another set of lexical units, the action and its result are much less specified (e.g., damage.v).  Compare this frame with Destroying, Cause_to_fragment, and Render_nonfunctional.
