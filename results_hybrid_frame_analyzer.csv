I open the door.,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,,,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a the door .,0.6,True,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the door"" involves an Agent (""I"") manipulating an object (""the door"") to change its state from closed to open, which aligns with the core action described in the Closure frame. However, the Closure frame emphasizes the manipulation of a Fastener, which is not explicitly mentioned or implied in the given sentence. The action described in the sentence is more direct and does not necessarily involve a fastener (e.g., a lock, knob, or handle) as an intermediary in the opening action. Therefore, while the sentence shares some thematic elements with the Closure frame, the lack of specificity regarding the manipulation of a Fastener reduces the alignment with the frame's core definition.

I open the door.,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,,,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.6,True,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the door"" involves a physical action performed by an agent (I) using a part of their body to achieve a change in state (the door being opened). The core action of opening aligns with the idea of performing a motion or action using the body, as described in the Body_movement frame. However, the specific action of opening a door might not perfectly align with the typical examples or the core focus of the Body_movement frame, which emphasizes the motion aspect more than the interaction with objects to change their state. The sentence does not explicitly mention the body part used or the motion involved, which are central to the Body_movement frame's definition. Therefore, while there is a physical action performed by an agent, the focus on opening an object might be better captured by a different frame that specifically addresses interactions with objects and their state changes.

I open the door.,an agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved.,,,I initiate the beginning of an ongoing open in which he will be continuously involved .,0.2,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the door"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (open) on an object (the door). However, the ""Activity_start"" frame is about initiating an ongoing Activity in which the Agent will be continuously involved. Opening a door is a discrete, one-time action rather than the beginning of an ongoing activity in which the Agent is continuously involved. Therefore, the core semantic roles and overall meaning of the ""Activity_start"" frame do not align perfectly with the sentence.

I close the door.,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,,,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a the door .,0.85,True,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the door"" aligns well with the core definition of the Closure frame, where an Agent (I) manipulates a Containing_object (the door) to close it. However, the specific mention of manipulating a Fastener to achieve closure is not present in the sentence, which might suggest a slight deviation from the full frame definition. Despite this, the core action of closing and the roles of Agent and Containing_object are perfectly matched, indicating that the essence of the Closure frame is preserved even without explicit mention of a Fastener.

I close the door.,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,,,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.5,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the door"" involves a physical action performed by an Agent (I) on an object (the door). While this action indeed involves body movement, the primary focus is not on the motion of the body part itself but on the effect that motion has on an external object. The Body_movement frame emphasizes motions or actions performed using the body, without necessarily focusing on the interaction with objects to achieve a specific change in state, such as closing a door. Therefore, the core semantic roles of the Body_movement frame do not align perfectly with the elements in the sentence, as the sentence's main focus is on the action's outcome (the door being closed) rather than the motion of the body part.

I close the door.,"a building or location that can be sealed to prevent entrance, the locale, ceases to be open for use.",,,"a building or location that can be sealed to prevent entrance , the the door , ceases to be open for use .",0.6,True,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the door"" involves a physical action performed by an agent (I) on an object (the door) to change its state from open to closed. The core semantic roles in the Locale_closure frame involve a location being sealed to prevent entrance, which indirectly involves the action of closing something like a door. However, the frame's focus is on the broader effect of a location becoming inaccessible, rather than the specific action of closing a door to achieve this state. Therefore, while the action of closing the door is related to the idea of a locale becoming closed, the sentence's focus on the specific action does not perfectly align with the frame's emphasis on the overall state of the locale being sealed off.

I knock on the door.,the words in this frame describe situations in which an agent or a cause injures a victim.,,,the words in this frame describe situations in which I or a cause injures a victim .,0.0,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I knock on the door"" does not align with the ""Cause_harm"" frame because the action of knocking on a door does not inherently involve causing injury to a victim. The core elements of the ""Cause_harm"" frame involve an Agent causing injury to a Victim, which does not match the context of the given sentence where the action is simply knocking on a door without any implication of harm or injury. Therefore, the semantic roles and the overall meaning of the ""Cause_harm"" frame do not apply to the sentence.

I knock on the door.,"an agent causes a theme to move from a source, along a path, to a goal.",,,"I cause a theme to move from a source , along a path , to a the door .",0.2,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I knock on the door"" does not align well with the core elements of the Cause_motion frame. In this sentence, the action of knocking does not cause a theme to move from a source, along a path, to a goal. Instead, the action is about creating a sound by hitting a surface (the door), without causing any object to change location or state in the manner described by the Cause_motion frame. The core semantic roles of Agent, Theme, Source, Path, and Goal do not map perfectly onto the elements of the sentence, as the sentence primarily involves an Agent (I) performing an action (knock) on a surface (the door) without causing motion of an object from one place to another.

Confidence: 0.2",,knock,Cause_motion,"An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    'She threw her shoes into the dryer .' 'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .' 'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked ""Metaphor"", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.

I knock on the door.,"while in motion, an impactor makes sudden, forcible contact with the impactee, or two impactors both move, mutually making forcible contact.",,,"while in motion , I make sudden , forcible contact with the the door , or two I both move , mutually making forcible contact .",0.7,True,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I knock on the door,"" the action of knocking involves making sudden, forcible contact, which aligns with the core definition of the Impact frame. The ""I"" serves as the Impactor, and ""the door"" serves as the Impactee. However, the action of knocking is typically more controlled and less forceful than the examples implied by the full frame definition, which suggests a higher level of force and motion (e.g., ""The massive metal foot hit the ground with a huge thud""). Therefore, while the basic elements of the Impact frame are present, the intensity and context might not align perfectly with the frame's typical examples.

I open the backpack.,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,,,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a the backpack .,0.9,True,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the backpack"" aligns well with the core elements of the Closure frame. The Agent (""I"") manipulates a Fastener (implied, as backpacks typically have zippers, buckles, or similar fasteners) to open a Containing_object (""the backpack""). The action and its direct effect—opening—are explicitly mentioned, fitting the frame's core definition of manipulating a fastener to open or close a containing object. Although the fastener itself is not explicitly mentioned, its presence is inherent in the action of opening a backpack, which matches the frame's allowance for the manipulator (and by extension, the fastener) to be syntactically omissible.

I open the backpack.,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,,,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.5,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the backpack"" involves a physical action performed by an Agent (I) on an Object (the backpack), which aligns with the notion of performing actions using some part of the body as described in the Body_movement frame. However, the action of opening a backpack does not inherently involve motion of the body in the sense of changing location or position, which is a central aspect of the Body_movement frame as it includes elements like Source, Path, Goal, and Area. The action of opening is more about manipulating an object rather than the body moving through space or changing its position significantly. Therefore, while there is a physical action performed by a body part, the core focus of the Body_movement frame on motion or movement through space does not perfectly align with the action of opening something.

I open the backpack.,an agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved.,,,I initiate the beginning of an ongoing open in which he will be continuously involved .,0.3,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the backpack"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (open) on an object (the backpack). However, the ""Activity_start"" frame is about initiating an ongoing activity in which the agent will be continuously involved, suggesting a temporal duration and involvement that goes beyond the immediate action of opening something. Opening a backpack is typically a discrete, one-time action rather than the beginning of an ongoing activity that the agent is continuously involved in. Therefore, the core semantic roles and the overall meaning of the ""Activity_start"" frame do not align perfectly with the sentence.

Confidence: 0.3",,open,Activity_start,"An Agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing Activity in which he will be continuously involved.

I close the backpack.,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,,,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a backpack .,0.9,True,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I close the backpack"" fits well within the ""Closure"" frame as defined. The Agent (""I"") is performing an action (manipulating a fastener, implied but not explicitly mentioned) to close a Containing_object (""backpack""). The core semantic roles of Agent, Fastener (implied by the action of closing), and Containing_object align perfectly with the elements present in the sentence. The sentence's focus on the physical action of closing and its direct effect on the backpack matches the core meaning of the frame. The absence of a specific fastener (e.g., zipper, button) does not detract from the match, as the frame accounts for the possibility that the Manipulator (in this case, the Agent) can be syntactically omissible or incorporate the Fastener implicitly.

However, the action of closing a backpack involves manipulating an object rather than performing a motion or action using a part of the body in the sense intended by the Body_movement frame. While the action does indeed require movement (e.g., moving one's hands to zip or buckle the backpack), the primary focus is on the effect on the object (the backpack being closed) rather than the motion of the body part itself.

In the sentence ""I close the backpack,"" the focus is on an object (the backpack) being closed, not a building or location. Therefore, the semantic roles do not align perfectly because the frame's definition specifies a building or location, whereas the sentence involves an object.

I tear the backpack.,an experiencer is involved in a bodily injury to a body_part.,,,an experiencer is involved in a bodily injury to a body_part .,0.0,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I tear the backpack"" involves an agent (I) performing an action (tear) on an object (the backpack). This does not align with the ""Experience_bodily_harm"" frame, which requires an experiencer to be involved in a bodily injury to a body part. In the given sentence, there is no mention or implication of bodily injury or an experiencer suffering from such an injury. The action is directed towards an inanimate object rather than a body part, and there is no indication of harm to the agent themselves or another individual.

I tear the backpack.,an agent affects a patient in such a way that the patient.,,,I affect a the backpack in such a way that the the backpack .,1.0,True,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I tear the backpack,"" the Agent (""I"") performs an action (tear) that affects a Patient (""the backpack"") in such a way that it likely ends up in a non-canonical (damaged) state. This aligns perfectly with the core definition of the Damaging frame, where an Agent affects a Patient leading to a non-canonical state. The verb ""tear"" is explicitly mentioned in the full frame definition as an example of an action that specifies both the means by which the Patient is altered and the detailed effect on the Patient, fitting the criteria for a perfect match.

Some lexical units of this frame indicate by what means the Patient is altered (e.g., scrape.v) and in some cases give some indication of the detailed effect on the Patient (e.g., score.v, chip.v), and in other cases, both are specified (tear.v).

I tear the backpack.,"an agent causes a theme to move away from a location, the source.",,,"I cause a the backpack to move away from a location , the source .",0.2,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I tear the backpack"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (tear) on a Theme (the backpack). However, the core action described does not involve moving the Theme away from a location, which is central to the ""Removing"" frame. Instead, the action of tearing implies damaging or rending the backpack, not relocating it.

I open the laptop.,an agent manipulates a fastener to open or close a containing_object.,,,I manipulate a fastener to open or close a laptop .,0.4,False,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the laptop"" involves an Agent (""I"") performing an action (to ""open"") on a Containing_object (""laptop""). However, the action of opening a laptop typically does not involve manipulating a Fastener in the same way as opening a coat with a belt or buttoning a coat. Laptops are generally opened by lifting a lid or screen rather than manipulating a fastener. Therefore, while the sentence shares some superficial similarities with the Closure frame—such as an Agent acting to change the state of a Containing_object—the core action of manipulating a Fastener to achieve this change is not present. This discrepancy suggests that the sentence does not perfectly align with the Closure frame as defined.

I open the laptop.,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,,,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.4,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the laptop"" involves an action performed by an agent (I) using a part of their body, likely hands, to perform a motion (open) on an object (the laptop). However, the core of the Body_movement frame emphasizes motions or actions that are primarily bodily without necessarily involving manipulation of objects as a central theme. Opening a laptop involves manipulation of an object rather than a focus on the movement of the body itself, which would be more aligned with frames related to handling or operating objects. Therefore, while there is a bodily action involved in the sentence, the primary focus is not on the body movement itself but on the interaction with an object to achieve a change in its state, which does not perfectly align with the core definition of the Body_movement frame.

I open the laptop.,an agent initiates the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved.,,,I initiate the beginning of an ongoing activity in which he will be continuously involved .,0.4,False,False,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I open the laptop"" involves an Agent (I) performing an action (open) on an object (the laptop). However, the action of opening a laptop does not inherently initiate an ongoing Activity in which the Agent will be continuously involved, as specified in the ""Activity_start"" frame.

I drop the pencil.,this frame contains words for motions or actions an agent performs using some part of his/her body.,,,this frame contains words for motions or actions I perform using some part of his / her body .,0.6,True,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" involves a physical action performed by an Agent (I) using a part of their body (likely the hand) to cause an object (the pencil) to move from one location to another, which aligns with the core definition of the Body_movement frame. However, the action of dropping does not inherently involve motion of the body part itself in a way that is central to the action's definition, unlike actions such as swinging, nodding, or jumping, which are more prototypical examples of the Body_movement frame. The action of dropping focuses more on the result of the motion (the pencil moving) rather than the motion of the body part itself. Therefore, while there is a physical action performed by an agent using their body, the focus on the object's movement rather than the agent's body movement suggests a partial but not perfect alignment with the Body_movement frame as defined.

The core of this action is the change in the pencil's location due to the act of dropping. The ""Path_shape"" frame, however, is centered around the description of the motion or shape of a path, often in a stationary or ""fictive"" sense, without any actual movement being performed by the path itself. The semantic roles in the ""Path_shape"" frame, such as the path's shape, direction, or its relationship to landmarks, do not align with the elements of the sentence, which involve an actor (I), an action (drop), and an object (the pencil).

I drop the pencil.,this frame consists of words that indicate the change of an item's position on a scale.,,,this frame consists of words that indicates the change of an the pencil 's position on a scale .,0.1,False,True,"Reasoning: The sentence ""I drop the pencil"" describes a physical action resulting in a change of the pencil's location from a higher to a lower position. This action does not inherently involve a scale, attribute, initial value, final value, path, difference, speed, or correlate as defined in the ""Change_position_on_a_scale"" frame. The core of this frame involves abstract or measurable changes along a defined scale, which does not align with the simple physical action of dropping an object described in the sentence.

Confidence: 0.1",,drop,Change_position_on_a_scale,"This frame consists of words that indicate the change of an Item's position on a scale (the Attribute) from a starting point (Initial_value) to an end point (Final_value). The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP ""turbot catches"" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to ""the people"", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP ""the population of Smallville"" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer ""of Smallville"" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute ""1999 price"" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as ""price"" on the 2nd layer. ",{'Item': 'the pencil'}

The frame ""Cause_change_of_position_on_a_scale"" is more suited to contexts where there is a measurable change in an attribute or value of an item, such as weight, price, or temperature, rather than a simple physical relocation.

I drop the pencil.,"an agent causes a theme to move from a source, along a path, to a goal.",,,"I cause a the pencil to move from a source , along a path , to a goal .",0.9,True,True,"Reasoning: In the sentence ""I drop the pencil,"" the Agent (""I"") causes the Theme (the pencil) to move, which aligns with the core definition of the Cause_motion frame. The action of dropping implies motion from a source (the Agent's hand or current position) to a goal (typically, the ground or a surface below the initial position), even though the source and goal are not explicitly mentioned. The frame's flexibility in leaving some elements like Source, Path, and/or Goal implicit supports this mapping. However, the specific manner of motion (dropping) implies a certain control at the Source but not throughout the motion, which is consistent with some examples provided in the frame definition.

Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.

CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves .

''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .'
